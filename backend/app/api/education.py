"""Education mode endpoints (NG-EDU-01/02).

An *activity* bundles teaching instructions with a starting network and a model
answer (both NG-WS-03 archive envelopes) plus a tree of weighted grading checks.
``/activities/{id}/grade`` runs those checks against a student's live project
and returns a per-item report with a live completion %.
