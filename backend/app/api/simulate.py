"""Simulation control endpoints.

``POST /simulate`` runs the discrete-event kernel over a project's topology and
returns a result summary. The lifecycle endpoints (pause/resume/step/stop) are
the control surface the frontend SimulationBar drives; for v0.1 the in-process
runner executes synchronously, so they return the current run state. A
distributed run-manager (Redis-backed job queue, see infra/redis-design.md) is
the production target.
