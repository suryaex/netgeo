"""WebSocket endpoints: live topology/telemetry and per-node console.

For v0.1 these are in-process broadcasters. Production fans out via Redis
pub/sub (infra/redis-design.md) so multiple API workers share one event bus.

Security note (security/threat-model.md): ``node_id`` on the console socket
MUST be re-authorized server-side once auth lands — never trust the path param
alone for access to a device console.
