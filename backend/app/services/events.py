"""In-process pub/sub bus for realtime topology + wireless events.

The web layer is event-driven: mutating endpoints (node/link create, update,
delete; map device placement) *publish* a typed event here, and every connected
``/ws/topology`` socket *subscribes* and relays it to its client. This decouples
the request path from the fan-out path — a POST /nodes returns immediately while
the broadcast happens off the back of an ``asyncio.Queue``.

v0.1 is single-process (one uvicorn worker). The interface is deliberately the
same shape you'd put in front of Redis pub/sub (``infra/redis-design.md``):
``publish(topic, event)`` + an async iterator of events. When we scale to
multiple workers, only :class:`TopologyBus` is swapped for a Redis-backed
implementation — subscribers and publishers are untouched.

Back-pressure: each subscriber has a bounded queue. If a slow client can't keep
up, its *oldest* events are dropped (a fresh snapshot supersedes stale deltas)
rather than blocking the publisher or growing memory without bound.
