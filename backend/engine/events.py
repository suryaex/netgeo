"""Discrete-event primitives: the event type, the event, and the event queue.

Determinism is a first-class requirement (MASTER_SPEC §1, reproducible runs).
The queue therefore orders events by a stable triple:

    (time, priority, sequence)

``sequence`` is a monotonically increasing tie-breaker so two events scheduled
for the *same* simulation time always pop in insertion order. This makes a run
bit-for-bit reproducible given the same model and seed — essential for
checkpoint/resume and for the "verify in simulation before deploy" promise of
ForgeOS (§5).
