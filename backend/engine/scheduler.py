"""The DES scheduler: advances the virtual clock by draining the event queue.

The scheduler is deliberately tiny and synchronous. It pulls the earliest
event, advances ``now`` to that event's time, and dispatches its handler. The
handler may push new events (always at ``time >= now``). The loop ends when the
queue empties, a time horizon is reached, or an external stop is requested.

Real-wall-clock pacing (so a UI can watch the sim "live") is handled one layer
up in :mod:`engine.simulation`; the scheduler itself runs as fast as possible.
