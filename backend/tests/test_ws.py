"""WebSocket realtime topology stream tests.

Proves the event-driven ``/ws/topology`` rework: on connect a client gets a
``snapshot`` + ``wireless.plan``, and when a geo device is later placed via the
REST API every connected client receives the recomputed plan — the core of map
mode's live coverage/topology updates.

Uses the sync Starlette ``TestClient`` (its background event loop shares the
process-wide repo + event bus singletons with the request path).
